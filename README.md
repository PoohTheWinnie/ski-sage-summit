## Getting Started Locally

First, create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
PINECONE_API_KEY=
```

Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=
```

Then, run the development server (python dependencies will be installed automatically here):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) â€“ feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).

## Key Features

### Chat Management
Users can create new conversations, view their chat history, and easily manage previous interactions. The intuitive interface allows for seamless switching between ongoing conversations and starting fresh ones. All conversations are saved automatically and can be deleted when no longer needed, giving users complete control over their interaction history.

### Encyclopedia RAG Model
The Ski Encyclopedia Mode uses a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to provide accurate, context-aware responses to skiing-related queries. Drawing from extensive skiing literature, it offers expert instruction on techniques, equipment, safety, and ski culture. The system combines vector-based retrieval with GPT-4 Turbo's reasoning to deliver highly relevant, factual information.

### Map Generation RAG Model
The Trail Map Mode leverages a specialized RAG system for retrieving and generating custom ski trail maps. Using CLIP image embeddings and DALL-E 3, it can create personalized trail maps based on user requirements like terrain type, difficulty level, and specific features. This combination of retrieval and generation produces accurate, visually appealing maps tailored to user preferences.

## Text Processing Pipeline
The project uses a sophisticated text processing pipeline to prepare documents for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. Here's how it works:

1. **Document Collection**
   - Place your source documents (PDF or TXT files) in the `data/texts` directory
   - Supported formats: PDF and TXT files
   - Documents can contain ski-related information, guides, or encyclopedic content

2. **Processing Pipeline**
   The pipeline processes documents through several stages:

   a. **Text Extraction & Processing**
      - Extracts raw text from PDFs and TXT files
      - Preserves document structure
      - Stores processed documents with metadata

   b. **Text Chunking**
      - Chunk Size: 1000 characters
      - Overlap: 200 characters
      - Intelligent splitting using recursive character text splitter
      - Preserves semantic boundaries using multiple separators:
        - Paragraphs (\n\n)
        - Lines (\n)
        - Sentences (., !, ?)
        - Clauses (,)
        - Words ( )

   c. **Vector Embedding**
      - Uses all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions) from chroma
      - Batch processing (100 chunks per batch)
      - Each chunk stored with:
        - Unique ID
        - Vector embedding
        - Metadata (title, source, chunk index)

   d. **Storage**
      - Vector store: Pinecone (serverless, AWS us-east-1)
      - Processed documents: `data/texts/processed/`
      - Text chunks: `data/texts/chunks/`
      - Vector embeddings: Stored in Pinecone index

3. **Running the Pipeline**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you have set up your environment variables
   export PINECONE_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   
   # Run the processing pipeline
   python backend/text_processor.py
   ```

The processed data is used by the Ski Encyclopedia Mode to provide accurate, context-aware responses to skiing-related queries.

## Encyclopedia RAG Model

The Ski Encyclopedia Mode uses a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to provide accurate, context-aware responses to skiing-related queries. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:
